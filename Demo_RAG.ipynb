Models such as StyleGAN [ 79], GPT [ 20,130,137,138], and Codex [ 28] have demonstrated that powerful generative\\nmodels can produce works at a human-like level of fidelity. Today, consumer applications such as ChatGPT1, DreamStu-\\ndio2, and DALL-E3are making these technologies widely available and setting the bar for people’s expectations of what\\ngenerative AI can do. Startups such as Cohere4and Anthropic5are reducing the friction of embedding large language\\nmodels in consumer applications. Enterprises such as IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are creating platforms for\\nbusinesses to infuse generative technologies into their products and services. This commercialization of generative AI technologies is fueled by the ultra-rapid development of large-scale foun-\\ndation models [ 19] that reduce the time and costs for developing generative AI systems. However, much attention in\\nmachine learning research communities has focused on developing advancements to the technology : scaling model\\nparameter counts [ 91,158], evaluating model performance [ 97,163,194], tuning models efficiently to perform new\\ntasks [ 27,178], and aligning models [ 132,196] to reduce their propensity to produce speech that is hateful, abusive,\\nprofane, or otherwise toxic [ 60,70]. Although these advancements serve to improve the state of the art, they do not\\nrecognize an important half of what Ehsan et al. [43] call the “human-AI assemblage” – the human . Generative models have enabled a radically new way for people to interact with computing technologies. People\\nare now able to craft specifications for the kinds of outputs they desire, such as via natural language prompts, and\\ngenerative models are able to produce outputs that conform to those specifications. Nielsen [127] recently identified\\nthis form of interaction as intent-based outcome specification and argued that it is the first new UI interaction paradigm\\nin 60 years. This form of interaction is fundamentally different from previous interaction paradigms (e.g. punchcards,\\ncommand line interfaces, and graphical user interfaces), because it shifts control over how computation is performed\\naway from the user and toward generative AI models. With this shift in control, how are we to design user experiences\\nthat help people interact with generative AI applications in effective and safe ways? Over at least the past four decades, researchers and practitioners within human-computer interaction (HCI) have\\nproduced numerous guidelines, principles, practices, and frameworks for the design of effective and safe computing\\nsystems. Some guidelines are presented as generally applicable to most kinds of interactive computing systems, such\\nas Nielsen and Molich’s heuristics [ 128] and Shneiderman et al .’s strategies for designing effective human-computer\\ninteraction [ 155]. Other design guidelines are technology-specific, such as Bevan’s guidelines for web usability [ 16] and\\n1ChatGPT. https://chat.openai.com\\n2DreamStudio. https://beta.dreamstudio.ai\\n3DALL-E. https://labs.openai.com\\n4Cohere. http://cohere.ai\\n5Anthropic. http://anthropic.com\\n2\\nDesign Principles for Generative AI Applications CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\\nvarious guidelines for AI systems and human-AI interaction [ 7,66,133]. However, none of the guidelines developed\\nwithin the HCI community have yet addressed the specific nuances present with generative AI. In this paper, we build upon the HCI tradition of distilling cumulative knowledge into a practical set of principles,\\nspecifically for the design of generative AI user experiences (UX). We opted to produce a set of principles , rather than\\nguidelines , to highlight their fundamental nature to the design of generative AI UX. Our paper makes the following contributions to the CHI community:\\n•Weintroduce a set of six principles for the design of generative AI applications (Table 1). Three principles\\nidentify new considerations for generative AI, and three offer new interpretations of known issues with AI\\nsystems. Each principle is coupled with a set of practical strategies and examples (Appendix A) for how to put\\nthe principle into practice – either through the design process itself or through specific UX capabilities – in order\\nto aid design practitioners6in applying the principles to real-world UX. •We establish the practical value of the design principles by conducting a rigorous and systematic validation\\nthat included multiple rounds of testing, feedback collection, iteration, and use by two generative AI application\\ndesign teams. •Weprovide insight on how we made decisions regarding the organization of the principles, navigated issues of\\nconceptual redundancy and overlap, and fostered adoption of the principles within our organization. 2 RELATED WORK\\nOver the past four decades, the HCI community has conducted numerous examinations of user interface design for\\ncomputing technologies and distilled best practices into various forms of design guidelines. We identify and review two\\ncategories of these guidelines: those that apply to the general UX design of computing systems and those that apply\\nspecifically to AI-infused systems. 2.1 Guidelines for human-computer interaction and user interface design\\nDesign guidelines have a rich history in HCI research. We provide a brief historical sketch of human-computer interaction\\ndesign guidelines and their evolution as a result of new paradigms in user interface technologies. Licklider and Clark provide an early example of guidelines for the design of console interfaces in, “On-line man-\\ncomputer communication” [ 99] (reflecting the gendered language of their time). Although their guidelines are not\\npresented in a modernly-recognizable form7, their work does introduce ideas about humans’ needs when working with\\ncomputers. Other early forms of human-computer interaction guidelines include those for the Spacelab Experiment\\nComputer Application Software (ECAS) [ 39], and for the command terminals of battlefield automated systems [ 156,157]. Even in these early days of user interface design, it was recognized that, “[l]acking consistent design principles, current\\npractice results in a fragmented and unsystematic approach to system design, especially where the user/operator-system\\ninteraction is concerned.” [156, p. v]. A significant inflection point in the design of user interfaces for computing technologies came with the rise of\\npersonal computing and the concurrent emergence of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) as a new interaction paradigm. New guidelines were needed for the new visual metaphors of windows, icons, menus, and pointers. Apple’s Human\\n6We consider a design practitioner to be anyone involved in making deliberate decisions that impact the design of an application, including user\\nresearchers, interaction designers, visual designers, product managers, and more. 7For example, they provide guidelines on allocating tasks between humans and computers that “exploit the complementation that exists between human\\ncapabilities and present computer capabilities” [99, p.114]. 3\\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Weisz et al. Interface Guidelines [ 8] provides a prominent example of practical guidelines for GUI design. Smith and Mosier [159]\\ndeveloped more formal guidelines for GUIs in which they described six functional areas: data entry, data display,\\nsequence control, user guidance, data transmission, and data protection. As Grudin described in an influential retrospective analysis [ 58], the “site” of human-computer interaction began\\nto move away from a terminal in a lab and “reached out” into other contexts such as home and office environments. New methods were required to understand and design for these changing circumstances. With heuristic evaluation\\n[128], Nielsen provided a set of methods for “discount usability engineering” [ 126] that helped designers more easily\\nassess their interfaces, while Lewis and Wharton’s cognitive walkthrough method [ 93] provided a way for designers to\\nconduct more detailed and tailored analysis. The next technological inflection point that necessitated a shift in design guidelines occurred with the rise of the Web. Unlike the previous decades, web design involved diverse and competing hardware and software. These complexities led\\nto what Mariage et al .describe as a “jungle of guidelines [intended to] address many different issues” [ 113, Introduction]. One result was that, out of 11 generic web design guidelines, Cappel and Huang found that a mean of only 5.5 guidelines\\nwere followed across 500 companies’ websites [ 25]. Adding to the diversity, technologically-literate advocates emerged\\nfor people with disabilities [ 92,141], older users [ 14,90], and users from diverse cultures [ 2]. Bevan [16] acknowledged\\nthat the available wealth of guidelines addressed different issues in different ways for different constituencies, and that\\nthis situation was likely to continue. The advent and widespread commercial adoption of smartphones, mobile apps, app stores, and mobile web sites\\nnecessitated yet another new design language, optimized for smaller screens and touch-based interactions. Some\\nwork in this space focused on developing design frameworks and guidelines for mobile apps and workflows (e.g.,\\n[61,78,109,124,136,151]). Guidelines also emerged covering mobile design for more specialized populations, including\\nolder users [ 5,30], users of courseware [ 71], users from diverse cultures [ 5], users with disabilities [ 134], and users\\nwith diverse literacies [ 162]. Guidelines were also developed for specific mobile app domains such as health care [ 4,75]\\nand finance [ 3,64,118], as well as ethical concerns around privacy [ 94,96] and the use of mobile apps for research\\npurposes [115, 142]. 2.2 Guidelines for human-AI interaction\\nWithin the past few years, the emergence of AI as a design material [ 41,46,62,191] has necessitated guidelines that\\ninform its use. A growing body of work within the human-centered AI research community has proposed best practices\\nfor human-AI interaction in the form of design guidelines (e.g., [ 7,11,104,186,192]), formal studies (e.g., [ 24,102]),\\ntoolkits (e.g., [110]), and reviews (e.g., [59, 72, 180, 188]). Some of these guidelines include claims of universal applicability8or being of a general nature to AI-infused systems\\n(e.g., [ 7,153]). Other guidelines focus on specific types of AI technologies (e.g. text-to-image models [ 104]), specific\\ndomains of use (e.g. creative writing [ 24]), or specific issues regarding the use of AI, including ethics [ 11,59,69,72],\\nfairness [ 110], human rights [ 50], explainability [ 119], and user trust [ 186]. Finally, as more consumer products\\nincorporate AI technologies, industry leaders including Google [ 133], Microsoft [ 7,95] and Apple [ 9] have developed\\nand published their own guidelines; Wright et al. [188] provide a comparative analysis of these guidelines. Guidelines that focus on the design of AI systems, and specifically on the ethics of those systems, are critically\\nimportant. Various attempts have been made to assist design practitioners in the process of operationalizing guidelines\\n8Multiple scholars have critiqued the concept of “universal” design as privileging certain assumed “normal” populations [12, 168]. 4\\nDesign Principles for Generative AI Applications CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\\nfor AI systems, including guidebooks [ 133], toolkits [ 36], and checklists [ 110]. When design guidelines are successfully\\napplied, they make a positive impact, such as in assisting cross-functional development teams in improving user experi-\\nences [ 95] and addressing ethical challenges [ 11]. However, several studies have critiqued their comprehensiveness [ 59],\\nthe extent to which they can be operationalized [ 50], and the lack of consequences when they are not followed [ 59]. Additionally, Madaio et al . [110] argues that the adoption of an AI ethics process within an organization, “would only\\nhappen if leadership changed organizational culture to make AI fairness a priority, similar to priorities and associated\\norganizational changes made by leadership to support security, accessibility, and privacy” [110, p. 8]. Despite the preponderance of guidelines for human-AI interaction and AI ethics, there is a gap in the technologies\\non which they focus. To date, many of the AI guidelines developed within the HCI community primarily focus on\\ndiscriminative AI [ 7,65,66,133], the class of algorithms that identifies boundaries that separate different classes or\\ngroups in a data set. These guidelines do not take into account generative AI algorithms that produce artifacts, rather\\nthan decision boundaries, as outputs. Because generative AI offers new ways for users to interact with technology, and\\nraises new issues regarding the ethics of AI systems, a new set of design guidelines are needed. 3 WHY GENERATIVE AI NEEDS DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nGenerative AI technologies have introduced a new paradigm of human-computer interaction, what Nielsen refers\\nto as “intent-based outcome specification” [ 127]. In this paradigm, users specify what they want , often using natural\\nlanguage9, but not how it should be produced. One challenge of this paradigm stems from the distinguishing characteristic\\nof generative AI: it generates artifacts as outputs and those outputs may vary in character or quality, even when a\\nuser’s input does not change. This characteristic has been described by Weisz et al . [182] asgenerative variability, and\\nit provides what Alvarado and Waern [6]describe as an “algorithmic experience,” raising questions on appropriate\\ntypes of user control, levels of algorithmic transparency, and user awareness of how the algorithms work and how to\\neffectively interact with them. With generative AI applications, users will need to develop a new set of skills to work with (not against) generative\\nvariability by learning how to create specifications that result in artifacts that match their desired intent. One emerging\\nskill revolves around crafting effective natural language prompts, known as in-context learning [ 20,40,189] or prompt\\nengineering [ 185,193]. This process is typically informal and relies on trial-and-error [ 104,131,165,190]. The use\\nof open-ended natural language, rather than a fixed vocabulary of commands, leads to new design challenges. For\\nexample, Nielsen argues, “users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the\\nsame thing” [ 125, p.156]; given the innumerable ways that users can express their intent in a natural language prompt,\\nhow can generative AI applications help users achieve desired results? Is it necessarily a “mistake” or “error” when a\\nuser’s prompt results in an output that they didn’t anticipate or like? Does it violate the consistency heuristic when it is\\ndifficult for users to achieve replicable results (e.g. [ 116,135,150]), because each click of the “generate” button results in\\ndifferent outputs, even for the same input? Existing human-AI design guidelines fail to address the unique design challenges of generative AI because they do\\nnot cover generative use cases or new considerations stemming from generative variability, and they do not cover new\\nor amplified ethical issues stemming from the models’ generative nature. For example, guidelines published by PAIR\\nmake recommendations such as, “Design for labelers & labeling” and “Design & evaluate the reward function” [ 133]. The former of these recommendations will not apply to generative use cases that do not require data labeling, as the\\n9Some user interfaces to generative AI systems allow users to specify their intent via sketches and gestures [ 32], UI controls [ 103,105], video-scanned\\nbody movements [174], and even various forms of improv performance [15, 68]. 5\\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Weisz et al. foundation models often used to implement generative capabilities are pre-trained and may not require additional\\nlabeled data for tuning. In addition, the latter recommendation is tailored to classification use cases in which false\\npositives and false negatives are important outcome metrics; in generative use cases, these metrics have no meaning. Guidelines from Amershi et al . [7] may be more readily adapted to generative AI applications, although their\\ncoverage of generative-specific considerations is limited and design practitioners may encounter difficulties in making\\nsuch adaptations. For example, the recommendation to, “Make clear why the system did what it did” is potentially\\nless important when a user’s goal is to simply generate a desirable artifact10. The recommendation to, “Make clear\\nwhat the system can do” may be difficult to implement in light of the emergent and unanticipated behaviors of\\ngenerative foundation models [ 19], as well as the trial-and-error methods by which users iterate toward a desired\\noutcome [104, 131, 165, 190]. Finally, alongside their tremendous potential to augment people’s creative capabilities, generative technologies also\\nintroduce new risks and potential user harms. These risks include issues of copyright and intellectual property [ 47,107],\\nthe circumvention or reverse-engineering of prompts through attacks [ 35], the production of hateful, toxic, or profane\\nlanguage [ 60], the disclosure of sensitive or personal information [ 83], the production of malicious source code [ 26,28],\\nand a lack of representation of minority groups due to underrepresentation in the training data [ 51,108,167,171]. Work\\nby Houde et al . [63] takes concerns such as these to an extreme by envisioning realistic, malicious uses of generative AI\\ntechnologies. Although it cannot be a designer’s responsibility to curb all potentially-harmful usage, existing design\\nguidelines for AI systems fall short in addressing these unique issues stemming from the generative nature of generative\\nAI, and AI ethics frameworks are only just starting to appear to provide designers with the language they need to begin\\ndiscussing these important issues [36, 66, 180]. We therefore conclude that there is a pressing need for a set of general design guidelines that help practitioners\\ndevelop applications that utilize generative AI technologies in safer and more effective ways – safer because of the new\\nrisks introduced by generative AI, and more effective because of the control that users have lost over the computational\\nprocess. Although recent work has begun to probe at design considerations for generative AI, this work has been\\nlimited to specific application domains or technologies. For example, guidelines of various maturity levels exist for\\nGAN-based interfaces [ 57,195], image creation [ 102,104,173], prompt engineering [ 102,104], virtual reality [ 169],\\ncollaborative storytelling [ 146], and workflows with co-creative systems [ 57,123,173]. Our work seeks to extend these\\nstudies toward principles that can be used across generative AI domains and technologies. 4 DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS\\nWe begin by presenting our final set of six design principles and their corresponding strategies in Table 1, along with\\nour overall design framework in Figure 1. We also provide extended descriptions and examples of each principle and\\nstrategy in Appendix A. In the rest of this paper, we describe the process we used to develop and validate these principles\\nand strategies. The principles are generally presented as high-level “design for... ” statements that indicate the characteristics that are\\nimportant to consider when making design decisions. Three principles focus on aspects of existing AI systems that\\nhave new interpretations through the lens of generative AI: Design Responsibly ,Design for Mental Models , and\\n10Research by Sun et al . [166] explores the kinds of questions that users have when working with a generative AI system, which include questions about\\nhow an artifact was produced. We posit that the utility of a generated artifact need not depend upon the mechanics of how that artifact was generated\\nin the same way that a user’s trust in a decision recommendation is often predicated on an explanation for how that recommendation was produced\\n(e.g. [ 10,98,172]). Further, some applications of generative AI concern the exploration of a space of multiple possibilities (e.g. [ 88,144]), indicating that in\\nsome use cases, how an artifact was generated may be of lesser importance than the generated artifacts themselves. 6\\nDesign Principles for Generative AI Applications CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\\nDesign Responsibly\\nEnsure the AI system solves real user issues and minimizes user\\nharms\\n•Use a human-centered approach* .

The right column contains principles that focus on new issues that stem\\nfrom generative AI technologies. Strategies that involve following a design process are indicated with an asterisk (*). 7\\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Weisz et al. Design for Appropriate Trust & Reliance . Three principles identify unique aspects of generative AI UX: Design for\\nGenerative Variability ,Design for Co-Creation , and Design for Imperfection . Each design principle is coupled with a set of four design strategies for how to implement that principle. In some\\ncases, implementing the principle involves following a design process; in other cases, it is implemented through the\\ninclusion of specific types of features or functionality. These principles and strategies can be employed to support two user goals: (1) optimization , in which the user seeks\\nto produce an output that satisfies some task-specific criteria; and (2) exploration , in which the user uses the generative\\nprocess to explore a domain, seek inspiration, and discover alternate possibilities in support of their own ideation. The ways each principle and strategy are applied may differ by user goal, and we elaborate on these differences in\\nSection 10.2. We note that these principles are just that – principles – and not hard rules that must be followed in all design\\nprocesses. Our view is that it is up to design practitioners to exercise their best judgement in deciding whether a\\nprinciple applies to their particular use case, and whether any particular strategy should (or should not) be applied. 5 METHODOLOGY\\nOur goal is to produce a set of clear, concise, and relevant design principles that can be readily applied by design\\npractitioners in the design of applications that incorporate generative AI technologies. We aim for the principles to\\nsatisfy the following desiderata:\\n•Provide designers with language to discuss UX issues unique to generative AI applications, motivated by work\\nthat provides designers with specialized vocabulary for domains such as video games [23, 81] and IoT [31];\\n•Provide designers with concrete strategies and examples that are useful for making difficult design decisions,\\nsuch as those that involve trade-offs between model capabilities and user needs, motivated by work that focuses\\nsimultaneously on end-users of systems [ 55] and on designers as strategic and collaborative end-users of\\nguidelines [82, 87]; and\\n•Sensitize designers to the possible risks of generative AI applications and their potential to cause a variety of\\nharms (inadvertent or intentional), and outline processes that could be used to avoid or mitigate those harms\\n(e.g. [66, 180]). We used an iterative process to develop and refine the design principles, inspired by the process used by Amershi\\net al. [7] in developing their guidelines for human-AI interaction. We crafted an initial set of design principles via a\\nliterature search (Section 6), refined those principles via multiple feedback channels (Section 7), conducted a modified\\nheuristic evaluation exercise to assess their clarity and relevance and identify any remaining gaps (Section 8), and\\nfinally applied the principles to two generative AI applications under design to demonstrate their applicability to design\\npractice (Section 9). In each iteration, we engaged in significant discussion and reflection on the feedback gathered from the previous\\niteration to produce a new version of the design principles and strategies. In some cases, principles or strategies moved\\nto the next iteration unchanged; in many cases, we made organizational and wording changes. We summarize our\\niterative process and the outcomes of each iteration in Table 2 and we show how the principles evolved over the\\niterations in Figure 2. 8\\nDesign Principles for Generative AI Applications CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\\nIteration Activity Goal Key Outcomes\\nIteration 1 Literature\\nReviewIdentify relevant research and examples\\nof generative AI application designObserved hierarchy of high-level design\\nprinciples implemented by specific UX de-\\nsign strategies; identified 7 initial design\\nprinciples\\nIteration 2 Feedback Collect feedback from conference work-\\nshop and designers within our institutionDeveloped clearer understanding of Explo-\\nration vs. Optimization purposes of use\\nIteration 3 Modified\\nHeuristic\\nEvaluationTest principles for clarity, relevance, and\\ncoverage by having designers evaluate\\ncommercial generative AI applicationsRecognized uniqueness of Generative Vari-\\nability, Co-Creation, and Imperfection to\\ngenerative AI; re-categorized Exploration\\nand Optimization separately as user goals\\nIteration 4 Application Demonstrate real-world applicability and\\nutility by having two product teams adopt\\nthe principles in their own design workObserved utility of principles across\\nideation and evaluation design phases;\\nmade clarity improvements to strategy de-\\nscriptions\\nTable 2.

Evolution of the design principles across four iterations. During Iteration 3, we recognized that some principles offered new\\ninterpretations of existing AI system characteristics whereas others identified new characteristics of generative AI. 6 ITERATION 1: CRAFTING INITIAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe began our process of identifying design guidelines suitable for generative AI applications by examining recent\\nresearch in the HCI and AI communities. We conducted a literature review of research studies, guidelines, and analytic\\nframeworks from these communities by searching the ACM Digital Library and Google Scholar for terms including\\n“generative AI, ” “design guidelines,” and “human-centered AI.” These searches identified a set of relevant publications,\\nas well as several recent workshops covering human-AI interaction with generative AI: Human-AI Co-Creation with\\nGenerative Models [ 52,112,181], Generative AI and HCI [ 122], Human-Centered AI [ 120], and Human-Centered\\nExplainable AI [ 44]. We then conducted additional searches for terms found within those workshops’ proceedings,\\nincluding “co-creation,” “human-AI collaboration,” “explainability,” and “creative interfaces.” Our searches yielded a\\n9\\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Weisz et al. representative sample of work that included new advancements and issues in generative AI11, design guidelines12,\\nstudies of design guideline implementation13, and studies of human interaction with AI (and generative AI) systems14. Finally, to incorporate recent industry developments around generative AI, we also examined a representative set of\\ncommercial generative applications (listed in Table 3) to identify common design patterns. One characteristic that stood out to us in our review was the difference between work that identified important\\nuser needs and the specific kinds of UX design that supported those needs. For example, one set of papers examined\\nrequirements for explainable AI (XAI) and human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) through experimental and heuristic\\nmethods [ 43,98,166], motivating “explainability” as an important high-level concept. Then, when examining a commer-\\ncial generative AI system (ChatGPT), we observed how explanations of the system’s capabilities and limitations were\\nprovided on the home screen. Observations such as these motivated our development of a two-tier principle/strategy\\nstructure in which a principle articulates an important characteristic or consideration for a generative AI application\\nand the strategies identify how to implement that principle in the UX. Our analysis helped us identify several characteristics unique to generative AI that have implications on the\\nuser experience: the models’ capability of producing multiple outputs [ 116,135,150], the possibility of flaws or\\nimperfections15within those outputs [ 183,184], and the various ways that people can control or influence those\\noutputs [ 85,103,105]. We also identified how generative AI could enable people to explore a space of possibilities [ 88]\\nas a byproduct of the generative process. In addition, we identified several existing considerations of AI systems as being\\nparticularly important to the generative case, such as using participatory methods [ 67] to design for real user needs\\nlike explainability [ 44,166], and understanding the role of the AI in the co-creative process [ 37,57,106,123,148,161]. At this stage, we identified 7 high-level principles and 22 specific strategies for implementing them. Some strategies\\nwere related to multiple principles, and at this stage we allowed the overlap; in subsequent iterations, we eliminated\\nthese redundancies (we discuss this point further in Section 10.1). 7 ITERATION 2: EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FEEDBACK\\nWe published the first iteration of the design principles at the Human-AI Co-Creation with Generative Models (HAI-\\nGEN) workshop at IUI [ 182], attended by approximately 50 researchers from academia and industry. At this workshop,\\nwe received informal feedback through discussion sessions and follow-up conversations. We also published this version\\nwithin our organization as part of a design guide on generative AI, which was viewed by over 1,000 design practitioners. We created an internal discussion channel on this guide to receive additional feedback, including points of confusion and\\ngaps in our framework. Both sources of informal feedback helped us craft the second iteration of the design principles,\\nwhich introduced the following major changes:\\n11Papers describing advancements and issues in generative AI, including demonstrations of new user interaction capabilities, included Brown et al .

A EXTENDED DESCRIPTIONS AND EXAMPLES\\nWe provide extended descriptions for each design principle and strategy to offer deeper insight into their meaning\\nand application, written in second-person for an audience of design practitioners. We also provide examples for each\\ndesign strategy to illustrate how they have been used in a realistic context. Each example was drawn either from a\\ncommercial generative AI application or an experimental generative AI system. Most examples were identified in the\\nmodified heuristic evaluation of Iteration 3; new examples were found for the three new strategies added after that\\niteration. For process-related strategies (denoted with an asterisk (*)), we discuss how the process would theoretically\\nbe applied as we did not have visibility into the actual design process for the generative AI applications we examined. We make reference to the following commercial systems in our examples:\\n•Adobe Firefly: https://firefly.adobe.com\\n•Adobe Photoshop: https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\\n•AIVA: https://www.aiva.ai/\\n•ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com\\n•DALL-E: https://labs.openai.com\\n•DreamStudio (powered by Stable Diffusion): https://dreamstudio.ai\\n•Github Copilot: https://github.com/features/copilot/\\n28\\nDesign Principles for Generative AI Applications CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\\n•Google Bard: https://bard.google.com\\n•Midjourney: https://midjourney.com\\nWe also note that a single type of UX feature or functionality can be used to implement more than one design\\nstrategy. We have included similar or duplicate examples below to illustrate this point. A.1 Design responsibly\\nThe most important principle to follow when designing generative AI systems is to design responsibly. The use of\\nall AI systems, including those that incorporate generative capabilities, may unfortunately lead to diverse forms of\\nharms, especially for people in vulnerable situations. As designers, it is imperative that we adopt a socio-technical\\nperspective toward designing responsibly: when technologists recommend new technical mechanisms to incorporate\\ninto a generative AI system, we should question how those mechanisms will improve the user’s experience, provide\\nthem with new capabilities, or address their pain points. A.1.1 Use a human-centered approach*. Technosolutionism is the idea that technology will solve all of our (human)\\nproblems, and it should be avoided at all costs. Human-centered approaches can determine whether the use of generative\\nAI is appropriate; use cases that apply these technologies for their own sake may fail to deliver real user value. Example : Human-centered approaches such as design thinking and participatory design allow you to observe users’\\nworkflows and pain points to ensure proposed uses of generative AI are aligned with users’ actual needs. For example,\\ninvolving stakeholders in the co-design of prototypes can serve as a probe for discussions around user value and\\ntechnological feasibility. A.1.2 Identify and resolve value tensions*. Often, there are multiple stakeholders involved in the creation of a generative\\nAI application, including the end users, those who design and build the application (e.g. designers, developers, product\\nmanagers), and those who make purchasing or licensing decisions (e.g. CIOs, CEOs). When these stakeholders’ values\\nare not aligned, it results in a value tension. Addressing these tensions is important for creating feasible and valuable\\nproducts that meet end users’ needs. Example : Value Sensitive Design (VSD) [ 48] is a method that can help designers identify who the important stake-\\nholders are and navigate the value tensions that exist across them. A.1.3 Expose or limit emergent behaviors*. Generative AI can exhibit emergent behaviors — the ability to perform tasks\\nbeyond ones they were trained for. These emergent behaviors can be a delighter, such as when a conversational Q&A\\nsystem answers an out-of-domain question, or they can be a risk, such as when that output is toxic or aggressive. As a\\ndesigner, you should carefully consider the trade-offs between optimizing your user experience for a well-defined set of\\ncapabilities versus providing a more open-ended experience that may surface potentially risky emergent behaviors. Example : Conversational interfaces that enable open-ended interactions will allow such emergent behaviors to\\nsurface. For example, a user may discover that ChatGPT can perform sentiment analysis, a task that it (likely) wasn’t\\nexplicitly trained to do. By contrast, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), such as AIVA, can place limits on the ways a user\\ncan interact with the underlying generative model by only exposing selected functionality. A.1.4 Test & monitor for user harms*. Generative models may produce a variety of harmful outputs, such as language\\nthat is hateful, abusive, profane, or otherwise toxic. They may also harm users by failing to produce outputs that provide\\na fair or accurate representation of diversity. It is imperative to work closely with technologists to understand and\\n29\\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Weisz et al. evaluate the potential risks stemming from the use of a generative model in an application. It is also imperative to\\nassume that user harms will occur and develop reporting and escalation mechanisms for when they do. Example : One way to test for harms is by benchmarking models on known data sets of hate speech [ 60] and\\nbias [ 45,149,171]. After deploying an application, harms can be flagged through mechanisms that allow users to report\\nproblematic model outputs. A.2 Design for mental models\\nA mental model is a simplified representation of the world that people use to process new information and make\\npredictions [ 80]. It is their own understanding of how something works and how their actions affect it. Generative\\nAI poses new challenges to users, and designers must carefully consider how to impart useful mental models to their\\nusers to help them understand how a system works and how their actions affect that system. Also consider the user’s\\nbackground and goals and how to help the AI form a “mental model” of the user. A.2.1 Orient the user to generative variability. Help the user understand the AI system’s behavior, and that it may\\nproduce multiple, varied outputs that may not be reproducible, even when given the same input. This behavior will be\\nunexpected for novice users because it is fundamentally different from traditional AI systems that always give the same\\noutcome for the same input. Example : Google Bard provides answers in the form of multiple drafts, indicating that it came up with multiple,\\nvaried answers for the same question. A.2.2 Teach effective use. Users need to understand how to work effectively with a generative AI application to\\naccomplish their goals. Mechanisms such as tutorials, examples, explanations, and social transparency [ 43] (i.e. showing\\nother users’ inputs and outputs) can help users form mental models for how to effectively use an application. Example : DALL-E provides curated examples of generated outputs and the prompts used to generate them. Adobe\\nPhotoshop provides pop-ups and tooltips to introduce the user to its Generative Fill feature. A.2.3 Understand the user’s mental model*. Conduct evaluations, such as interviews, to determine whether a user has\\nformed a useful mental model of a generative AI application. One prompt that can be useful to ask is how they think\\nthe application provides a certain capability, which forces the user to articulate their theory of how the system works. The goal is not for the user to possess an accurate model, but rather, one that is useful for working effectively with the\\nsystem. Furthermore, understanding the user’s mental model can also help you leverage their existing knowledge of\\nsimilar applications to inform your design decisions. Example : In evaluating a Q&A application, you might ask the user, “how did the system answer your question about\\nwho the current President is?” Answers such as, “it looked it up on the web” might indicate a need to educate users\\nabout hallucination issues. Users’ existing mental models of other applications can also be useful to understand. For\\nexample, Github Copilot builds on users’ mental models by following the same interaction pattern as its existing code\\ncompletion features, which are familiar to many developers, hence easing their learning curve. A.2.4 Teach the AI system about the user. LLMs are adept at tailoring their language to a target audience. Designers\\ncan induce these models to produce personalized responses to users – in essence, teaching the model about the user\\n– by including additional prompt text such as, “explain like I’m five” or “please give me a detailed, technical answer.”\\nCapturing the user’s expectations, behaviors, and preferences can improve the AI’s interactions with them. Users can\\n30\\nDesign Principles for Generative AI Applications CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\\nalso provide information about their background in UI outside of their prompt, which the application can then opaquely\\nincorporate back into the prompt. Example : ChatGPT provides a form for “Custom Instructions” in which users provide answers to questions such as,\\n“Where are you based?”, “What do you do for work?”, and “What subjects can you talk about for hours?” In this way,\\nusers teach ChatGPT about themselves in order to receive more personalized responses. A.3 Design for appropriate trust & reliance\\nTrustworthy generative AI applications are those that produce high-quality, useful, and (where applicable) factual\\noutputs that are faithful to a source of truth. Calibrating users’ trust is crucial for establishing appropriate reliance:\\nteaching users to scrutinize a model’s outputs for quality issues, inaccuracies, biases, underrepresentation, and other\\nissues to determine whether they are acceptable (e.g. because they achieve a certain level of quality or veracity) or if\\nthey should be modified or rejected. A.3.1 Calibrate trust using explanations. Be clear and upfront about what the application can and cannot do by\\nexplaining its capabilities and limitations. Teach users to be skeptical of potentially imperfect model outputs and help\\nthem understand when they can trust the system. Example : ChatGPT explains its capabilities (e.g. “answer questions, help you learn, write code, brainstorm together”)\\nand limitations (e.g. “ChatGPT may give you inaccurate information. It’s not intended to give advice.”) directly on its\\nintroduction screen. Google Bard provides a notice below the prompt field that states, “Bard may display inaccurate or\\noffensive information that doesn’t represent Google’s views.”\\nA.3.2 Provide rationales for outputs. Show the user why a particular output was generated by showing the model’s\\n“chain of thought” [ 179] or identifying the source materials used to generate it. For example, identifying source documents\\nfor answers expected to be factually correct or revealing the image sets that a text-to-image model was trained on can\\nhelp users calibrate their trust. Example : Google Bard provides a list of sources it used to produce answers to questions. Adobe discloses that its\\nGenerative Fill feature was trained on “stock imagery, openly licensed work, and public domain content where the\\ncopyright has expired” [1]. A.3.3 Use friction to avoid overreliance. Encourage the user to review and think critically about the generative model’s\\noutputs by introducing mechanisms that slow them down at key decision-making points. These mechanisms are known\\nas cognitive forcing functions [ 22]. Examples include offering multiple AI-generated options for the user to select from,\\nhighlighting uncertainty, or requiring the user to create content or render a decision before showing the AI’s output. Example : Google Bard displays multiple drafts for the user to review, which can encourage them to slow down and\\nconsider which drafts may be of lower or higher quality. A.3.4 Signify the role of the AI. AI systems may act in different roles, such as “tools,” “partners,” “analytics,” or\\n“coaches” [ 114]. These roles shape users’ expectations of how the AI system fits into their workflow, such as the extent\\nto which it takes initiative (e.g. by acting proactively vs.')]"

Conversely, the quality of food packaging does not significantly impact overall satisfaction. However, the study underscores the crucial role of application design and user interface in shaping consumer behavior. Both factors significantly influence overall satisfaction, with user-friendly interfaces attracting more users and promoting frequent app usage. The findings emphasize the importance of businesses addressing these attributes to enhance customer satisfaction, boost app engagement, and foster long-term customer loyalty.

            "Assistant: The paper \"Design Principles for Generative AI Applications\" presents a set of six design principles for the design of applications that incorporate generative AI technologies. These principles address the unique characteristics of generative AI user experiences and offer new interpretations and extensions of known issues in the design of AI applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "The six design principles are:\n",
            "1. Design Responsibly: Ensure the AI system solves real user issues and minimizes user harms.\n",
            "2. Design for Generative Variability: Help the user manage the ability of generative models to produce multiple outputs that are distinct and varied.\n",
            "3. Design for Mental Models: Communicate how to work effectively with the AI system, considering the user’s background and goals.\n",
            "4. Design for Co-Creation: Enable the user to influence the generative process and work collaboratively with the AI system.\n",

The study reveals that a diverse range of restaurants positively influences consumer satisfaction, leading to increased app usage. Conversely, the quality of food packaging does not significantly impact overall satisfaction. However, the study underscores the crucial role of application design and user interface in shaping consumer behavior. Both factors significantly influence overall satisfaction, with user-friendly interfaces attracting more users and promoting frequent app usage. The findings emphasize the importance of businesses addressing these attributes to enhance customer satisfaction, boost app engagement, and foster long-term customer loyalty. Understanding and catering to consumer preferences in these areas can contribute to the success of food delivery apps in the competitive market.\n",
